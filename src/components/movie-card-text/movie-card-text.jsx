        In the 1930s, the Grand Budapest Hotel is a popular European ski resort,
        presided over by concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Zero, a junior
        lobby boy, becomes Gustave&apos;s friend and protege.

        Gustave prides himself on providing first-className service to the
        hotel&apos;s guests, including satisfying the sexual needs of the many
        elderly women who stay there. When one of Gustave&apos;s lovers dies
        mysteriously, Gustave finds himself the recipient of a priceless
        painting and the chief suspect in her murder.
